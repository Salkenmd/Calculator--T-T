# Calculator--T-T ???
Just a project to learn numerical analysis and IEEE 754

PS. 12/13/2025
Trying to get ARM Cortex-M4 on my hands if I will be able to learn C and Assembly for STM32F4 series. Trying to improve hardware's poor precision of E-7 by software implementation.

TODO:
1. Debloat the python code (Done. Kind of)
2. Seperate the math stuff (Done?)
3. Port python prototype to C. (In progress)
4. Suffer to 32-bit ARM ASM. (not yet)

Extra TODO:
1. Write a little documentation on how this all works.
