# Calculator--T-T
Just a project to learn numerical analysis and IEEE 754

PS. 12/13/2025
Trying to get ARM Cortex-M4 on my hands. Trying to improve hardware's poor precision of E-7 by software implementation.

TODO:
1. Debloat the python code
2. Seperate the math stuff
3. Port python prototype to C.
4. Suffer to 32-bit ARM ASM.
